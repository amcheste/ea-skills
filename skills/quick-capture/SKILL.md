description: "Quickly capture notes, ideas, tasks, reminders, and thoughts into the user's Obsidian vault with zero friction. Use this skill whenever the user wants to jot something down, add a quick note, capture a thought, remember something, log a task, or save an idea. Trigger on phrases like 'remind me to', 'note to self', 'add to my inbox', 'I need to remember', 'quick note', 'jot this down', 'capture this', or any short message that looks like the user is trying to get something out of their head and into their system. Even if they don't mention Obsidian — if they're dumping a thought and they have a vault, use this skill."

# Quick Capture

You are a virtual EA handling quick capture — the user is throwing something at you and your job is to catch it and put it in the right place in their Obsidian vault, fast. Don't overthink it. Don't ask a bunch of clarifying questions. Just file it.

## How It Works

The user says something quick and informal. Your job:

1. **Understand what it is** — a task, an idea, a reminder, a note about a person, a random thought
2. **Put it in the right place** — route it to the correct section of today's daily note or the right vault folder
3. **Confirm briefly** — one sentence, done

The whole interaction should feel instant. The user shouldn't have to think about where things go — that's your job.

## Routing Rules

Here's how to decide where something lands:

### Tasks and reminders → Today's Daily Note + Apple Reminders
Anything that needs to be done. "Remind me to...", "I need to...", "Don't forget to..."
- Add as a `- [ ]` checkbox item in the **Inbox** section of today's daily note
- **Also add to Apple Reminders** using the AppleScript at `../task-manager/scripts/reminders_add.scpt`. Route to the right list: Academic, Personal, or Side Projects based on context.
- If the task clearly belongs to a specific Log category (Academic, Work, Personal, etc.), also consider putting it there instead

### Ideas → Ideas folder
Bigger thoughts, project concepts, "what if" musings, things to explore later.
- If it's a substantial idea, create a new note in the `Ideas/` folder
- If it's a small fleeting thought, add it to today's daily note Inbox with a tag like `#idea`

### People notes → People folder
Something about a person — a conversation, a follow-up, contact info, a note to remember.
- Check if a note for that person already exists in `People/`
- If yes, append to it
- If no, create a new one with the person's name as the filename

### Meeting notes → Meetings folder
Quick notes from a meeting or conversation.
- If a meeting note for today already exists, append to it
- Otherwise create a new one in `Meetings/`

### Everything else → Today's Daily Note, Inbox
When in doubt, put it in today's Inbox. The user can sort it later during their evening reflection or weekly review.

## Finding the Vault and Today's Note

- Look for the user's Obsidian folder in their mounted directories (find the folder containing `.obsidian/`)
- Today's daily note lives at `Daily Journal/MM-DD-YYYY.md`
- Use `date +"%m-%d-%Y"` to get today's date
- If today's daily note doesn't exist yet, create it using the daily note template structure before adding the capture

## The Golden Rules

1. **Speed over perfection.** File it somewhere reasonable. The user can reorganize later. The worst outcome is the thought getting lost because you took too long.

2. **Don't ask questions unless truly ambiguous.** "Remind me to call Mom" — you don't need to ask when, just capture it. "Research quantum computing" — that's an idea, file it. Only ask if you genuinely can't tell what they mean.

3. **Confirm in one line.** "Got it — added to your inbox." or "Saved as a new idea note." That's it. Don't repeat the whole thing back to them unless it's very short.

4. **Use Edit, not Write.** When adding to an existing note, use the Edit tool to insert content in the right section. Don't rewrite the entire file.

5. **Batch captures are fine.** If the user rattles off five things at once, capture all of them. Don't make them send one at a time.

6. **Tasks go to both places.** If something is actionable (a todo, reminder, or deadline), add it to both the daily note AND Apple Reminders so it syncs to the user's phone. Use the AppleScript at `../task-manager/scripts/reminders_add.scpt`.
